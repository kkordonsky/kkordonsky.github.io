    <h4>Corporate	Social Responsibility	and	Litigation Risk<span class="no-bold"> (Job Market Paper)</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Securities litigation is costly for firms. This study investigates whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) helps reduce the litigation risk of a firm. First, using a sample of over 22,000 firm-year observations between 2005 and 2015, I show that firms improve corporate social performance when facing increased litigation risk. Second, using a two-stage least square framework to correct for the endogenous nature of investment in CSR, I find evidence that a better CSR image reduces the probability of a securities class action lawsuit filed. Next, I use propensity score matching to create a control sample of firms with a similar probability to commit fraud and the same propensity to be sued. Repeating the analysis for the sample of sued and control firms; I confirm my findings that CSR helps reduce the probability of a lawsuit filed. The analysis also shows that a positive CSR image translates into lower market penalties when firms are revealed to have committed fraud. The lower market penalty is a possible explanation for the reduced probability of a lawsuit filed. These findings demonstrate the 'insurance-like' property of CSR activity through its ability to reduce the costs of securities litigation.</p>

    <h4>The Market Cost of Unethical Conduct: Revealing Differing Market Reactions to Employee and Firm Indictments for FCPA Violations<br><span class="no-bold">with Martin Boyer</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines stock market reactions to firm indictments for bribery violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). We use an original, hand-collected sample comprising 125 events of FCPA enforcement actions brought against firms and employees by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice between 1986 and 2015. We contribute to the literature on the effects of illegal and unethical firm activities by examining the impacts of indictments according to defendant types. We study stock market reactions to indictments naming firms, their subsidiaries, or employees as defendants. We do not find any evidence that the market reacts to indictments for bribery brought against the parent company or its subsidiaries. In contrast, we find a statistically significant and negative market reaction when firm employees are named in the enforcement action. This result holds after controlling for numerous other characteristics of the violation and alternative model specifications. Our findings suggest that shareholders do not penalize firms for bribery unless the enforcement action names an employee.</p>

    <h4>On the Expected Liability Cost of Cross-Listing into the United States: Evidence from Directors' and Officers' Insurance<br><span class="no-bold">with Martin Boyer</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the expected managerial liability cost for a firm that lists its shares of common stock in the United States. More specifically, the paper examines the structure of a firm's Directors' and Officers' liability insurance contract, which offers financial protection to a firm's managers in the event they are sued as the firm's representatives, before and after cross-listing into the United States. All else equal, neither the likelihood of having insurance nor the insurance coverage change following cross-listing. The D&amp;O premium and the D&O premium per dollar of coverage do change, however, as both double following cross-listing. Since operations are unlikely to have changed following cross-listing, these results provide evidence that the increased litigation risk associated with being listed in the United States is more due to an increase in the frequency of litigations against directors and officers than to an increase in their severity</p>

    <h4>Securities Class Actions and Informed Trading in the Options Market<br><span class="no-bold">with Gunnar Grass</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We document suspicious trading activity (STA) in the options market ahead of revelations of fraud that trigger a securities class action filing. Using a battery of informed trading measures we provide robust evidence of the existence of STA before fraud revelation events. We apply various propensity score techniques to show that STA is higher among fraud firms than the matched control samples. Our results are consistent with the view that fraudulent activity inside a firm increases the likelihood of illegal trading activity by insiders.</p>
